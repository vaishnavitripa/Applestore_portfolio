## Data cleaning and Analysis

During this project, performed the following task:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.

  
## Findings will be on these questions.

1. What app categories are most popular?
2. What price should I set?
3. How can I maximise user rating?

## Insights

Based on the findings, these are the recommendations:

1. Paid apps have better ratings.
2. Apps supporting between 10 & 30 languages have better ratings.
3. Finance and book apps have low rating. So building a finance based app will help as its market is saturated.
4. Apps with a longer description have better ratings.
5. A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5.
6. Games and entertainment have high competition.
