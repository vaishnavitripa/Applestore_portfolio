## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the app performance and what categories a client should make an app on. By analysing various categories, we seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of market performance.

## Data Source

Apps Data - The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'appleappstore.csv' file, containg detailed informations about various apps on apple app store.

## Tools

- Excel - for data cleaning
- Sql Server - Data analysis
- Tableau - visualisation

## Data cleaning and Analysis

During this project, performed the following task:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.

  
## Findings will be on these questions.

1. What app categories are most popular?
2. What price should I set?
3. How can I maximise user rating?

## Insights

Based on the findings, these are the recommendations:

1. Paid apps have better ratings.
2. Apps supporting between 10 & 30 languages have better ratings.
3. Finance and book apps have low rating. So building a finance based app will help as its market is saturated.
4. Apps with a longer description have better ratings.
5. A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5.
6. Games and entertainment have high competition.
